# Wordpress Freelancer Client Panel

The WP Freelancer Client Panel started as a simple concept in 2009. After putting the project on the shelves for almost two years, I will be continuing my work and publishing version 0.2-alpha with-in the next 90 days. The concept is to give access to Freelancers and Small Web Design Firms a quick and easy setup to manage clients, implement multiple billing solutions, setup portfolios, manage multiple document types such as contracts/terms/non-disclosures/seo-checklist, newsletter and mailing list management, and much more. The idea for this project was "in my head" for over a year until recently when I put together a formal plan for the project. More to come soon.
